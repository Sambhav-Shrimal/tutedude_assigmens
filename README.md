this repo is to submit my assignment 

about the simple program i created

program 1 - take input from users and do arithmetic operations
it takes in input from the user, input includes the numbers they want to operate on and how many operations they waant to perform.
Once they have entered the no. of arirhmetic operations they want to perform, a loop is created asking for arithmetic operation symbol (+,-*,/). the loop will go on according to number of operations the user has asked to perform.

I could do it the simple way. but just wanted to have more fun. So used for loop with range function.

progrma 2- concat the 1st and last names os the user
this was simple just create two variables asking the user to input their firs and last name and adding both the variable respectively( since both are string)s we'll get the desired output.

thats it!
